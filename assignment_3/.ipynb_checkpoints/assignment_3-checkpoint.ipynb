    "\\end{eqnarray}\n",
    "\n",
    "The three dimensionless parameters are $\\sigma$, the Prandtl number (the ratio of the kinematic viscosity to the thermal diffusivity), the Rayleigh number $r$ (which depends on the vertical temperature difference between the top and bottom of the atmosphere), and b, which is a dimensionless length scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that there are non-linear terms in the second and third equations;\n",
    "these terms result in very complex dynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to \n",
    "1. code up the equations, using a function definition, with a proper docstrings (inside triple quotes)\n",
    "2. use an ode solver of your choice, i.e., solve\\_ivp, or ode, to integrate the equations for t=60 (in dimensionless time units). Use Lorenz' initial conditions $W_0=[0., 1., 0.]$ and his parameter values [$\\sigma, r, b$] = [10., 28, 8./3.].\n",
    "3. reproduce Lorenz' Figure 1. Label both axes! Note that Lorenz uses $N=t/\\Delta t$ to label his plots (here $\\Delta t=0.01$).\n",
    "4. reproduce Lorenz' Figure 2. You will likely have to ask for output at very closely spaced time intervals, e.g., if you use solve\\_ivp, you will need something like t = np.linspace(14, 19, 1000) followed by W = sol.sol(t). Again, label both axes.\n",
    "5. find the solution using the same values of $(\\sigma, r, b)$, but this time with initial conditions very slightly different than $W_0$, say $W'_0 = W_0+[0., 1.e-8, 0] = [0., 1.00000001, 0.]$; note that adding the two lists (as indicated here) will not work, so you should google to find out how to add two lists element by element. Calculate the distance between $W'$ and $W$ as a function of time, and plot the result on a semilog plot (linear time, log distance). \n",
