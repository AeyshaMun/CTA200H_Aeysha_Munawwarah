    "\n",
    "The goal of the SURP project is to determine if intermediate mass black holes (IMBHs) in Milky Way globular clusters (GCs) are a significant source of hypervelocity stars (HVSs) in the Milky Way. How many fast stars should there be out there? How do they depend on the properties of the cluster or IMBH that ejected them? Are they detectable today or in the near future with the observational facilities we have? [Here](https://lweb.cfa.harvard.edu/~wbrown/Files/ARAA2015.pdf) is a useful review on HVSs. Sections 5-7 are fairly outdated but 1-4 have aged well.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll start with a different situation already implemented in `speedystar`, where stars are being ejected following interactions with Sgr A* in the Galactic Centre. Changing assumptions about the ejection model and seeing what impact that has on the HVS population will give you some practice poking around and making changes to the code, analyzing its outputs and get you thinking about how the situation will differ when we consider ejections from GCs."

    "### 4 The impact of stellar metallicity\n",
    "\n",
    "* Yet another way the Galactic Centre differs from GCs is in the metallicity of the ejected stars. The default in `speedystar.eject.Hills()` is to assume all stars have the same metallicity as the Sun. In reality, stars in the Galactic Centre have a range of metallicites and are probably on average [slightly more metal-rich](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.494..396F/abstract) than the Sun. Stars in GCs, on the other hand, have metallicities an order of magnitude (or lower) than the Sun. This impacts the physical sizes and lifetimes of the stars, so their maximum flight times and maximum ejection velocities are lower and they will have different apparent magnitudes.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Figure out how to change the assumed metallicity in `speedystar.eject.Hills()` and set it to -1, i.e. metallicity 1/10th of Solar. How does the HVS population change?"
